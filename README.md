# JaredBGreat's Minefantasy Expansion

An ecclectic exapansion for MineFantasy II by AnonymousProductions.

This primarily does two things.  First, it adds thing from MineFantasy I that I suspect will not return in
MineFantasy II, such as stone types that have been replace by fire clay and the old herbs. Second it adds 
compatibility with some other mods; so far this means Dynamic Sword Skills by coolalias, but others may be
added, such as adding custom MF2 items to loot in dugeon mods.

It also adds a simple telepad, since on severs I often found nether travel too dangerous due to mobs mods that
I was using, and ended up using the Llapis Portals Bukkit plugin.  Thus these are replacements for Llapis Portals 
which will also be available in single player.  These portals may be spun-off into a small mod for those not 
playing with MineFantasy, and have a Doom inspired pentagram aesthetic since they were first dreamed up for a 
Doomlike Dungeons expansion.

Other than the telepads and storage blocks, all assets were created by Anonymous Productions or Erurion (I think? For the tan clay 
walls) and were borrowed from MineFantasy I.

Code under jaredbgreat.minefantasy is the creation of Jared Blackburn, and is his intellectual property.  Other 
code is the property of other authors as listen in those source files.

While I prefer the more permissive Creative Commons lisence for most things, this does not use it, due to require 
code from GPL'ed mods.  Therefore the code is under the Gnu General Public Lisence version 3.0 (GPL 3.0):

(I have not yet looked into how this effects assests; I may have to modify that to fit the borrowed assets.)
